You are tasked with designing a school management system in C#. The system should support the following:

Students
Teachers
Courses
School

Please design an application to represent these entities and establish the appropriate relationships between them.

1. Planning Phase

There is no expectation to finish or build a fully functional app. 

30 min time limit - when you say go 

Don't have UI

What is important - project setup - establishing relationships

Clean Architecture.
Layered. 
Okay - 30m - one project - all my Data access, bl , etc - explain why

Data Access - 4 Tables - 4 Classes

Student: 
Id, First Name, Last Name

Teacher: 
Id, First Name, Last Name

Course - School  

2. Project Setup


SCHOOL----> TEACHERS ----> COURSES 
	\-----> STUDENTS
	 \-----> COURSES -----> STUDENTS

Schools have teachers, teachers teach courses
Schools have students
Schools have courses, students learn courses

By setting it up this way we define the order of the relationships in the school: The School's teachers teach courses to students.
By usings SchoolID at the center of it all, we connect and organize the secondary components of the different reltionships under the primary 
one (ultimately each category belongs first and foremost to the school it happens in). By using schoolID we also open up the possiblity of adding
other schools later on.

So we will have 4 different tables
1.Courses
2.School
3.Students
4.Teachers

Courses
	-CourseID
	-Course Name
	-Credits
	-SchoolID 
	-StudentID

School
	-SchoolID
	-Name
	-Address

Students
	-StudentID
	-Student First Name
	-Student Last Name
	-SchoolID

Teachers
	-TeacherID
	-Teacher First Name
	-Teaacher Last Name
	-SchoolID
	-CourseID
