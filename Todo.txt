Need to use something other than a DTO for inserts, because ideneity auto generates 
the ID for each insert x

make school so I can test inserts because of FK constraints x

make CreateRequests and UpdateRequests for inserts of students, enrollments, and teachers like you did for courses x

test the rest of the requests that come after bulk insert courses x

Make it so you cant add the same json twice x

Courses x

Teachers x

Students x

Enrollments x

add the proper encapsulations to the different classes in each project 

double check security for each project
